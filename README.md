# tic-tac-toe
The classic Tic Tac Toe game made to play in the PyCharm console.

## Description
Before starting the game, users are presented with a 3-by-3 matrix, where each of the 9 cells are given a number. When it's the user's turn ("X" player vs. "O" player), he/she simply types in the number where he/she wants to place the mark. The matrix is printed after each time a player places the mark. Whoever forms a line wins.
